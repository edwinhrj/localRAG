# Local Retrieval-Augmented-Generation Desktop App

## Overview

This project provides a downloadable, packaged GUI for a local Retrieval-Augmented-Generation (RAG) desktop application. Designed with security in mind, this app enables users to upload files locally for processing without exposing sensitive company or trade secret data to third-party AI databases.

### Key Features:
Local File Uploads: Ensures that files are processed entirely on the user's machine, preventing sensitive information from being transmitted to external servers.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation: Uses advanced AI techniques to provide accurate, contextually relevant responses by leveraging a local vector database.
Secure File Handling: The app ensures that all uploaded files remain within the local environment, safeguarding proprietary data.
Cross-Platform Support: Available for Windows, macOS, and Linux, making it easy to deploy in various environments.

### Benefits:
Data Privacy: Protect your company's confidential files by keeping all processing local.
Efficiency: Benefit from powerful retrieval-augmented generation capabilities without compromising security.
User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive and easy-to-use interface for seamless interaction with the backend.

### Technologies Used:
Frontend: Electron.js for the GUI
Backend: Python (Ollama, SQLitevec for vector storage)
AI Model: Retrieval-Augmented Generation

### Installation:
Download the appropriate version for your operating system.
Run the executable file to launch the app.
Upload files securely within the app for local processing.
